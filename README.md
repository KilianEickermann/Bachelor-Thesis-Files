Bachelor Thesis Code
This repository contains the code developed for my Bachelor's Thesis.

The code is primarily split into two distinct analytical sections:

VAR Analysis: This section includes all scripts and resources related to the Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis performed as part of the thesis.

DiD Analysis: This section comprises the code and data processing for the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis.

Each section will likely contain its own set of scripts, data handling, and potentially further documentation to facilitate understanding and replication of the analysis.
