# Bachelor Thesis Code

This repository contains the R code developed for my Bachelor's Thesis.

The code is primarily split into two distinct analytical sections:

* **VAR Analysis:** This section includes all scripts and resources related to the Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis performed as part of the thesis. The primary script for this analysis is `VAR_Analysis.R`. Note: The required data for the Bank of Japan's interest rate in the `DiD_Japan-Germany.R` script can be found in the data folder.

* **DiD Analysis:** This section comprises the code and data processing for the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis. The scripts for this analysis include `DiD_US-Germany.R` and `DiD_Japan-Germany.R`.

Each section contains its own set of scripts, data handling, and potentially further documentation to facilitate understanding and replication of the analysis.
